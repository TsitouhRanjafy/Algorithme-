## ðŸ“š Algorithms Included

### 1. **Recursion & Backtracking**
- ðŸ”— [Recursive Functions](https://github.com/TsitouhRanjafy/Python/tree/recursive)  
  Dive into a series of recursive function implementations that solve common algorithmic problems through recursion.

- ðŸ”— [Prime Numbers](https://github.com/TsitouhRanjafy/Python/blob/base/base.py)  
  Efficient methods to identify prime numbers, leveraging number theory and recursion.

- ðŸ”— [Palindrome Partitioning](https://github.com/TsitouhRanjafy/Python/tree/palindrome.partitioning)  
  Solve the palindrome partitioning problem using backtracking techniques. Break a string into all possible palindromic partitions.

- ðŸ”— [Merge Array](#) : [LeetCode 88](#)
  Python solution for merging two sorted arrays in-place. The algorithm runs in `O(m + n)` time complexity and uses `O(1)` extra space.
